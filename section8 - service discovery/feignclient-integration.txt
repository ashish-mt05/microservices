1. add openfeign dependecny.
2. put @EnableFeignClient annotation on top of main class.
3. create one interface nd top of that put @FeignClient
and then pass spring.application.name as parameter.
4. create on method same as we have created in CardController

@FeignClient("cards")
public interface CardsFeignClient {

    @GetMapping(value = "/api/fetch",consumes = "application/json")
    public ResponseEntity<CardsDto> fetchCardDetails(@RequestParam String mobileNumber);

}
